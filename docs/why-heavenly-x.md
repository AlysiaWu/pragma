# Why Heavenly-x?

## It's Declarative

Definitions are concise, readable, and maintainable. [A simple todo app](./getting-started/basic-todo-app.md) with user authentication and permissions can be expressed in under 30 lines of code.

## It Runs Locally

You can easily set up the Heavenly Runtime on you laptop and start development within minutes. Whenever the application is ready for deployment, you can deploy it to your own servers, or any cloud platform where you can install Heavenly-x.

## No Vendor Lock-In

Heavenly-x applications are extremely easy to migrate from any cloud provider to the next one. This is possible because of the simplicity and automated deployment management that Heavenly-x provides.

## It Follows Industry Standards

Heavenly-x applications conform to familiar industry standards such as GraphQL and OAuth2, so there's nothing abnormal about the interface of Heavenly-x APIs.
