# Why Pragma?

## It's Declarative

Definitions are concise, readable, and maintainable. [A simple todo app](./getting-started/basic-todo-app.md) with user authentication and permissions can be expressed in under 30 lines of code.

## It Integrates with Many Languages

You can define the functions used for data processing in many languages, including JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, LLVM languages (Rust, Go, C, C++, etc), and seemlessly compose them using [directives](./features/directives.md).

## It Runs Locally

You can easily install Pragma on you laptop and start development within seconds. Whenever the application is ready for deployment, you can deploy it to your own servers, or any cloud platform where you can install Pragma.

## No Vendor Lock-In

Pragma applications are extremely easy to move from any cloud provider to another.

## Databse-agnostic

You can use any kind of database technology that you like with Pragma. If your favorite database technology is not natively supported by the language, it's very easy to write an adapter and share it with the community.
